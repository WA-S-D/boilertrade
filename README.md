## Inspiration
It's common knowledge that college students don't have a lot of money to spend. So if you try to sell something online in a college town you might not get many takers. But what about trading the stuff you don't need anymore? Enter BoilerTrade, where you can post things you're willing to trade, and look for things you need, all without exchanging a dollar. 
## What it does
Users can log in using gmail credentials and then browse local posts. Users can upload their own posts with a photo and a brief description. Users are able to contact each other about posts using email through Twilio.
## How we built it
We built the web application using MERN stack. MongoDB stores all of the information about posts and users, Express and Node make up the middleware, and React handles the front end.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few issues with integrating front-end and back-end, as well as publishing the website.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a finished and well-tested product that achieved what we set it out to achieve.
## What we learned
We left the project with a greater knowledge on the details of the MERN stack and how to use it to its fullest extent. 
## What's next for BoilerTrade
We will continue working on BoilerTrade in the future: search filter, spam bot, recommendation system using machine learning, etc.
